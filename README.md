Research Review: A CNN Based Bagging Learning Approach 
to Short-Term Load Forecasting in Smart Grid

Background

This research review entails the key concepts of providing a relevant approach to short-term load forecasting in Smart Grid. Convolutional Neural networks(CNN) was presented in this research review as it was used to instruct forecasting models on huge data sets. Key techniques were also highlighted in the reading such as short-term load forecasting(STLF) to display to the reader what approach can be taken for the smart grid. Each section of the research review details proposed theories to address this challenge. Section I was the intro, section II detailed the illustrated method, section III highlighted the method evaluations and section IV closed the research review out with the conclusion and recommendations. With the conducted experiment discussed in the research review and suggestions, the learning approach could solutified this challenge currently faced.

Motivation/Challenges

The motivation behind this proposed model was to find the most effective way for forecasting hourly load in a smart grid. Throughout the conduction of the experiment there were some challenges faced. For starters, the model cannot process large long time data. Another challenge faced was the submodels not being automatically retained.

Methodology

In the methodology section of the research review, the detailed steps of the proposed procedure. The procedure is divided in three stages in order to conduct a successful experiment. In the first stage, load data was collected and CNN trained models on data sets. The second stage was the building of CNN bagging learning model and the last stage was the construction of the submodels for metrics evaluation. Once these phases are implemented properly, then the experiment will be successfully run and results can be recorded.

Discussion

In section III, the experiment is conducted and the results are recorded. First, the data set was collected in order to guarantee the success of the model. Next the base models are picked for method comparison. Lastly, the results are calculated using the evaluation metrics. After these steps were taken, the experimental results concluded that reorganization of samples is a more effective method of short-term forecasting.

Conclusion

In conclusion, the presented CNN learning approach was suggested in regards to forecasting hourly load in the smart grid. In the conducted experiment, the CNN models were edified on large data sets which resulted in great improvement for forecasting performance. Although the 

experiment displayed great results, there were still improvements that were needed. This research review thoroughly details the need for this approach, the steps needed to achieve this approach and future improvements that should be conducted in the future.
